###This code creates and evaluates 5 card poker hands.

>The code is unit tested and will run without an IDE,
personally I prefer sublime and the terminal but you are free to utilise whichever editor you're suited with.

The purpose of this project is to help me improve my javascript algorithm skills. Javascript testing experience and coding style.
